Project Type: Type II - Original Monte Carlo Analysis 

Project Overview: Our project involves using Monte Carlo simulations to analyze win probabilities in the dice game "吹牛骰子" (Liar's Dice). We aim to understand how different strategies impact win probabilities under varied conditions. Specifically, we will simulate scenarios involving dice rolls and player choices to estimate success rates for different strategies.
